# Horiseon-Marketing-Solutions

## 
This was the first project in the coding bootcamp with UW. My goal for this was to clean up the code to be easier to read, and to make sure that the elements worked correctly. I also wanted to make sure that the boxes were spaced evenly, as well as the long verticle one on the right side.

I ran into some headaches with the boxes and the text staying inside of them. I want to do some work on flex boxes and come back in the future to make is so that the issue mentioned above doesnt happen.

I enjoyed going through the text and adjusting/cleaning it up. I ran into a problem where I removed the ID's that allowed the headers at the top to link to the paragraphs in the body and didnt realize it until I went back with a copy of the original and checked my work. That was pretty cool to find, as I really didnt think they were there for any specific reason and now for the future I can use that to link to other parts of the page.

As a whole I think this was a really fun first homework and I am looking forward to the rest of the class!
