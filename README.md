This was the first homework in the coding bootcamp with UW. My goal for this was to clean up the html and css that was provided to be easier to read, make sure that the elements worked correctly, and had correct syntax.

I ran into some headaches with having text staying inside the boxes when the screen has the size changed. I am working on bootstrapping and flex boxes to solve this issue. I am having some issues with understanding the grid formatting.

I enjoyed going through the text and adjusting/cleaning it up. I ran into a problem where I removed the ids that allowed navigation headers at the top to link to the paragraphs in the body and didnt realize it until I went back with a copy of the original and checked my work. That was pretty cool to find and can use this feature in the future.

As a whole I think this was a really fun first homework and I am looking forward to the rest of the class!

Also after learning more about beautify I think that tool will be extremely helpful in the future. I used it on a second copy of this and found that it had also removed the id allowing the navigation also, so I went back in the copy and changed some syntax and was this time unchanged by the clean up. This was nice to see that I could clean up some other formatting and allow for my navigation to work in one.
